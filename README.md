# <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
Insight Data Science is an intensive postdoctoral training fellowship that bridges the gap between academia and a career in data science. As part of the program, I had the wonderful opportunity to consult with _Borrow My Style_*, a fashion e-commerce startup. My client company provides a peer-2-peer rental community where they wish to enable people to either rent or sell fashion items such as dresses, handbags, shoes, and accessories as well. The purpose of this blog post is to detail the models that were produced to evaluate inventory performance and provide a recommendation system for lenders.

*For the purposes of anonymity _Borrow My Style_ is a pseudonym for consulting client.

### <a name="about_me">About the Author</a>

My name is Emmanuel Contreras-Campana. I received a Ph.D. in experimental high energy physics searching for anomalous production of multilepton events in proton-proton collision at the LHC complex collected by CMS collaboration. I am seeking opportunities in big data analytics in the financial, technology, or health industries. My passion is working with complicated datasets that require rigorous transformations and cleaning in the interest of extracting useful insights that have substantive business value. Last summer, I completed a data science internship at TripleLift. They are in the marketing and advertising industry. I had the opportunity to worked on predicting viewability of digital ads to improve advertiser spending.
